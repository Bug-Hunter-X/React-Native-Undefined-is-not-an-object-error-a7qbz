# React Native Undefined is not an object Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: 'Undefined is not an object (evaluating '...someComponent.someProperty')'.  The error arises when trying to access a property of an undefined object. This often happens when a component hasn't been properly imported, is not yet mounted, or when dealing with asynchronous data.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected version. The solution focuses on properly handling asynchronous operations and ensuring components are defined and imported before usage.

This is a crucial problem for React Native developers, as it often arises from working with APIs or navigating complex component hierarchies.
